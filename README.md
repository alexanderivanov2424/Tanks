# How to Run

## Backend

This is where the game logic happens

> navigate to: compananta/src/server  
> run: npm start

## Server

This is what serves the page to the client

> navigate to: compananta/  
> run: npm start

## Ngrok

We used ngrok so friends not on our wifi can also play

ngrok downloaded as an exe:

> navigate to ngrok download path
> start ngrok.exe  
> run: ngrok http 3000

If you have ngrok in your path like a normal person:

> run: ngrok http 3000

To kill loose ngrok sessions on windows:

> taskkill /f /im ngrok.exe
